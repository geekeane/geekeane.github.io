<h2>About Our School</h2>
<center>
<p id="About-Our-School">Founded in 1914 by the Basilian Fathers, Celtic Secondary School is a co-educational, semestered school located in northwest Los Angeles. <br>

The area is a residential neighbourhood with an Elementary School (Spirit Heights), a hospital (Hallmark General), and a community college (Spartans College) in close proximity. <br>
The housing around our school includes individual dwellings and town-homes. Our school has a longstanding partnership with St. Jayson's Roman Catholic Church, the parish church. 
<br>
School facilities consist of a newly-renovated, air-conditioned building which features a new leadership centre, dramatic arts studio, ME/DD room, and cafetorium.
<br>
Our school has a rich tradition of academics, athletics, and extra-curricular activities. Numerous championship banners adorn the gym walls. Our dramatic productions, art exhibits, drum-line and musical performances are visible demonstrations of our school’s spirit.
<br>
Our school is also rich in community spirit. The saying “At Celtic, We Care” is reflective of the day-to-day operation of the school. 
<br>
Our school motto, “Domine ut videam” - “Lord that I might see,” expresses the goal of the Celtic community - to promote, in the fullest sense, each student's growth as a person.</p>
