<h1>About Our Specialized Art School Department</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"id="Header-Art">Developing Art</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"id="Developing-Art">Students at St. Celtic High School learn to think critically by observing, conceptualizing, and organizingÂ information. This allows them to respond creatively and independently to the ideas of others as well as to the artistic expression of their own genuine thoughts.
<br>
Students understand art, music, and theatre within a personal, current, and historical context using creative and critical analytical processes. They have the chance to investigate how media and art affect how people see their own identities, cultures, and morals.</p>
